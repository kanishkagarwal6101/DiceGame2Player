# DiceGame2Player

This here is a 2 player dice game, 
where when each player rolls and dice his score gets added to the current score and if he rolls a 'one' then unluckily his current score resets,
but if he chooses to hold the score then all the current score gets added to the total score and then it's player 2's turn to roll the dice, 
if the player's total score reaches 100 and he holds it then he/she wins the game.
